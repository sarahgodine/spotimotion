# spotimotion

In the base-level directory, the Python files are the scripts used to pull data from Spotify. `spotifyGrabber.py` was the original script, which hit rate limits on the API, so it was broken into several smaller scripts. They are executed in the following order:

1. `$ python3 getTracks.py`
2. `$ python3 getTime.py`
3. `$ python3 getFeatures.py`
4. `$ python3 plotResults.py`

The CSV files contain data from the latest run-through of the programs. The file results.txt contains statistical data which was written while executing `plotResults.py`.

In the Plots folder are scatter plots, generated by Python, for all of the audio features we analyzed, all plotted against months as well as years.

In the Events folder, there are modified versions of the same python scripts, which were customized to find event data. The CSV files hold data for specific dates surrounding significant events. There is also a scatter plot showing the valence of Spotify listens during the time period.

### gDelt
In the gDelt folder is another python script, used to calculate the avgTone feature for certain time periods. There is also event data from the GDelt database, and graphs of the avgTone around certain significant events.

### countries
In the countries folder there are several scripts, .csv files for each country's top charts and data, and box plots for valence of each country. The scripts are executed as followed in order:

1. `$ python3 getTracks.py`
2. `$ python3 getFeatures.py`
2. `$ python3 plotResults.py`
